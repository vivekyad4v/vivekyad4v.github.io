## **Terraform is Terrafic!**

You are gonna love it too. Have covered below in "basics-lesson1" -    

➛ Create VPC with 3 public & private subnets span across 3 AZs with internet & NAT Gateway.   
➛ Create IAM policies, roles & instance profiles.    
➛ Create Autoscaling groups, Launch templates & SSH Key pairs for Application & Bastion host.    
➛ Create Target group & Application load balancer.   
➛ Create security groups for Application, ALB, Bastion & Database instance.

Just a single command and you create all of the above in no time. Terraform core takes care of all the inter-dependencies, I love this functionality.

Here you go, straight into the action -

(A lot more to come, fork/star it if you like it :-))
